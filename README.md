The unity project has the following stuff set up:
- [x] the server and client set up for data streaming
- [x] particle system to visualize the data
- [x] different features to make the visualization dynamic: color, rightAscension, declination(temporary)

How to use it:
- [x] I also have a example set up, download the Cient_SendData.zip, and unzip it to run the randomGeneratorExample to sent random data to unity


ToDo:
- [ ] make the visuals looks awesome
- [ ] UI with gesture and voice command
