The unity has the following stuff set up:
- the server and client set up for data streaming
- particle system to visualize the data
- different features to make the visualization dynamic: color, rightAscension, declination(temporary)

How to use it:
- I also have a example set up, download the Cient_SendData.zip, and unzip it to run the randomGeneratorExample to sent random data to unity


ToDo:
- [x] make the visuals looks awesome
- [x] UI with gesture and voice command
